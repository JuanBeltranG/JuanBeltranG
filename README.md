## Hi there, I'm Juan 

### I am a software engineering student passionate about technology.

<br/>

* ðŸ“š I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering.
* ðŸ’» Currently studying and honing my skills in web development using the MEAN stack
* ðŸ“± Also I know a little about cross platform apps development using Flutter and Dart
* ðŸ’¡ I like competitive programming and everything related to algorithms, I'm not very good at it but I still like it.



<br/>
Everytime I code a "hello world" program in a new programming language I can feel the power in my hands.

```CPP
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
```

```JAVA
String hello = "Hello World";
System.out.println(hello);
```
